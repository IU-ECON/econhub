                            <p>Beyond his academic career, Lloyd had many interests across a wide range of activities; playing his trombone in numerous settings including the Bloomington Community Band, flying airplanes with his close friend and colleague Scott Gordon, skiing with family, and motorcycle riding. He clearly had a heart and mind for adventure. He was also known as a strong advocate for social justice, including active involvement in various programs to assist those in need.</p>
